# Juni's OLA11 Final Project

This Project is a very hacky series of scripts to do the following:

1. Conjugate a given verb or noun (based on stuff learned in OLA11) properly

2. Search for exceptions that are installed

3. Have a rudimentary package manager to install these exceptions from an
   outside source. (probably on github pages)
